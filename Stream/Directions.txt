Once you have ssh access into Cloud Lab, follow these steps to run the Stream
Memory Bandwidth benchmark:

The stream benchmark is a simple benchmark program that measures sustainable memory bandwidth when performing simple
operations on different vectors.

ssh -p 22 BF842382@clnodevm107-1.clemson.cloudlab.us

1.) Clone the git hub repo into the Cloud Lab ssh.
    - $ git clone https://github.com/FC868370/CloudProject.git

2.) cd into that new github repo.
    - $ cd CloudProject

3.) Change the branch from master to docker.
    - $ git checkout docker

4.) cd into the Stream folder.
    - $ cd Stream

5.) Run the Stream Benchmark.
    - $ bash runStream.sh
    
This will build a Docker Image and will then run the benchmark. It will also create a new directory 'results'
and store the benchmark results in a docker.log file.

6.) cd into the Results directory.
    - $ cd results
    
7.) View benchmark results.
    - $ cat docker.log


The Stream Benchmark will run 20 times showing the results in four main vector kernels: Copy, Scale, Add, and Triad. 
It will show the average time, minimum time, and maximum time.
